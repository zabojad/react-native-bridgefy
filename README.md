# React Native interface for Bridgefy
This repository contains a module for [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) that is an interface to use [Bridgefy SDK](https://www.bridgefy.me/), this interface can be used for Android and iOS projects. If you want to know how to use the framework natively in android, you can find it [here](https://github.com/bridgefy/bridgefy-android-samples/blob/master/README.md), in the other hand the official iOS repository is [here](https://bitbucket.org/bridgefy/bridgefy-ios-dist).

## Install on existing project

**Note:**
This section explains how to add Bridgefy to an existing project with native code. If you don't know how to create a Native React project with native code, you can check it [here](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html), under the tab **Building Projects with Native Code**.  

Let's suppose your project name is `AwesomeProject`, go to the root directory of the project and run the following command:

```
npm install --save react-native-bridgefy
```
or 
```
yarn add react-native-bridgefy
```

It will download and install the bridgefy module.  
At this point you already have the module, but in order to be able to use it, you will need to make some configurations for every platform.

### Android install

We assume you are using React Native >= 0.60.x (supports auto linking).

Please follow those steps to have a working Android setup:

* Edit your `android/build.gradle` file and ensure your are targetting Android SDK >= 21:
```xml
buildscript {
    ext {
        minSdkVersion = 21
        // ...
```

* Edit your `android/app/build.gradle` file to add the followind code:
```xml
repositories {
  maven {
    url "http://maven.bridgefy.com/artifactory/libs-release-local"
    artifactUrls = ["http://jcenter.bintray.com/"]
  }
}
```

* Then add the following permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:  
```java
android.permission.BLUETOOTH
android.permission.BLUETOOTH_ADMIN
android.permission.INTERNET
```
If you're targeting devices with Android  6.0 (**API Level 23**) or higher, either one of the following permissions is also required:

```java
android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION
android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION
```

### iOS Install

Again, we assume you are using React Native >= 0.60 (with auto linking).

* Run `cd ios && pod install && cd ..`,

* Edit your project's Info.plist file and add a entry for `NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription` (describe there why your app needs usage of Bluetooth)

* Ensure your project's minimum deployment target is set to at least iOS 11.0.

* Ensure your project's PodFile is set to at least iOS 11:

```
  platform :ios, '11.0'
```

* In case you need to use Bridgefy in background mode, add both "BLE peripheral" and "BLE accessory" capabilities in XCode.

### Install BFTransmitter framework manually (Optional)

By default, the module will install the BFTransmitter framework from pod. If you do not want to install it via pods, you can also install the BFTransmitter.framework manually as described  [there](https://github.com/bridgefy/bridgefy-ios-developer#manual-setup).

## Usage

### Initialization

First, make sure you have an API KEY to use the framework, if you don't have it, please go to the Bridgefy [site](https://www.bridgefy.me/) to get one. You will need to indicate the bundle id of your Android and iOS native projects.

To start to work with the framework in Javascript, you will have to import it to the `.js` file you will be working, so add the following code:

```javascript
import RNBridgefy from 'react-native-bridgefy';
import {
    ...
    NativeEventEmitter,
    ...
  } from 'react-native';

const bridgefyEmitter = new NativeEventEmitter(RNBridgefy);
```  
Before any use, you will need to initialize the Bridgefy engine, you can do it with the following code, just change the text `BRIDGEFY_API_KEY` with your actual API_KEY:  

```javascript
RNBridgefy.init("BRIDGEFY_API_KEY")
  .then((client)=> {
    console.log(client);
  })
  .catch((e)=>{
    console.error(e);
  });
```
If the initialization fails you will get an `errorCode` (Integer) and a `message` (string) that indicates the reason of the failute. If the initialization is successful you will get a `client` dictionary, that is described in the Appendix section.  

### Start and stop the service

To keep resources, you will need to start the transmitter before use it, this is the code to do it:
```javascript
// Bridgefy SDK options, for more details, see BridgefyOptions below
let options = {
  autoConnect: true, // use automatic mode
  encryption: true // connections will be secure and messages encrypted
}
RNBridgefy.start(options)
  .then(()=> {
    // Bridgefy SDK started!
  })
  .catch((e)=>{
    // Bridgefy SDK could not start! Check `e` for more information...
  });
```
Once you finished using the service you can stop it by using the following code:
```javascript
RNBridgefy.stop();
```

### Automatic and On-demand modes

You can use Bridgefy in two different modes: "Automatic" and "On-demand".

More information about those modes for [iOS](https://github.com/bridgefy/bridgefy-ios-developer#operation-modes) and [Android](https://github.com/bridgefy/bridgefy-android-samples#starting-operations).

#### Automatic mode

When using Bridgefy in Automatic mode, you do not have to manage connecting to users, it is done automatically for you by the Bridgefy SDK.

Each time a user will be connected to you, the `onDeviceConnected` event will be thown along with the user information.

Similarly, the `onDeviceLost` event will be raised every time a user disconnects from you.

#### On-demand mode

In the On-demand mode, you will have to connect to other devices once you've detected them. You know when a device is detected when the `onDeviceDetected` event is raised (along with the device information).

When a device is detected, you can call the `connectDevice` function to connect it and be then able to send messages to it:
```js
RNBridgefy.connectDevice({userId:"..."})
  .then(()->{
    // connect done
  });
```

If you want to disconnect from a device, you call:
```js
RNBridgefy.disconnectDevice({userId:"..."})
  .then(()->{
    // disconnect done
  });
```

You know when you are connected to a device when the `onDeviceConnected` event is raised (similarly to the automatic mode). You also know when you are disconnected from a device when the `onDeviceLost` event  is raised.

When a device becomes unavailable (un-detected), the `onDeviceUnavailable` event is raised along with the device information.


### Sending messages

You can send a message to an specific user, you need the identifier for that user (we will explain in the next section how to obtain it), this message will be tried to be delivered even if the receiver user is not connected right now (using our mesh algorithm). An example of how to send a direct message is the following:

```javascript
  var message = {
                 content:{ 
                          message: "Hello world!!",
                          language: "English"
                 },
                 receiver_id: "A_STRING_USER_IDENTIFIER",
               };
 RNBridgefy.sendMessage(message);
```
You create a dictionary with the fields `content` and `receiver_id`. `content` can contain whatever you want, even another dictionary, as long the data types you use comply with the ones supported by JSON format. `receiver_id` is the identifier for the receiver user.  

You can also send a broadcast message, a broadcast message is a message that will be delivered to all nearby users, not to an specific user. As direct messages do, it will be sent even to no connected users using the mesh algorithm. Example:

```javascript
  var message = {
                 content:{ // Custom content
                          message:"Hello world!!"
                 }
                };
 RNBridgefy.sendBroadcastMessage(message);
```
The dictionary just contains the field `content`, whose structure was explained before. Also note that the method invoked is `sendBroadcastMessage`.

### Listeners

You will need to implement some listeners in order to receive messages, detect nearby users and get their user identifier, failures, etc. The following code is an example about how you can do it, every listener has a comment explaining what is its purpose:

```javascript

    //
    // Message listeners
    //   

    // This event is launched when a message has been received, 
    // the `message` dictionary structure is explained in the appendix
    bridgefyEmitter.addListener(('onMessageReceived', (message)=> {
                        console.log('onMessageReceived: '+ JSON.stringify(message));
                      }
    );

    // This event is launched when a broadcast message has been received, the structure 
    // of the dictionary received is explained in the appendix.
    bridgefyEmitter.addListener(('onBroadcastMessageReceived', (message)=> {
                        console.log('onMessageReceived: '+ JSON.stringify(message));
                      }
    );

    // This event is launched when a message could not be sent, it receives an error
    // whose structure will be explained in the appendix
    bridgefyEmitter.addListener(('onMessageFailed', (error)=> {
                        console.log('onMessageFailed: '+ error);

                        console.log('code: ' + error.conde); // error code
                        console.log('message' + error.message); // message object
                        console.log('description' + error.description); // Error cause 

                      }
    );

    // This event is launched when a message was sent, contains the message
    // itself, and the structure of message is explained in the appendix.
    bridgefyEmitter.addListener(('onMessageSent', (message)=> {
                        console.log('onMessageSent: '+ JSON.stringify(message));
                      }
    );

    // This event is launched every time there is a progress in sending message data
    bridgefyEmitter.addListener(('onMessageDataProgress', (evt)=> {
        console.log('onMessageDataProgress: '+ JSON.stringify(evt));
      }
    );

    // This event is launched when a message was received but it contains errors, 
    // the structure for this kind of error is explained in the appendix.
    // This method is launched exclusively on Android.
    bridgefyEmitter.addListener(('onMessageReceivedException', (error)=> {
      
                        console.log('onMessageReceivedException: '+ error);
                        console.log('sender: ' + error.sender); // User ID of the sender
                        console.log('code: ' + error.code); // error code
                        console.log('message' + error.message); // message object empty
                        console.log('description' + error.description); // Error cause 

                      }
    );

    //
    // Device listeners
    //   

    // This event is launched when the service has been started successfully, it receives
    // a device dictionary that will be descripted in the appendix.
    bridgefyEmitter.addListener(('onStarted', (device)=> {
                        // For now, device is an empty dictionary
                      }
    );

    // This event is launched when the Bridgefy service fails on the start, it receives
    // a dictionary (error) that will be explained in the appendix.
    bridgefyEmitter.addListener(('onStartError', (error)=> {
                        console.log('onStartError: '+ error);
                        console.log('code: ' + error.conde); // error code
                        console.log('description' + error.description); // Error cause 
                      }
    );

    // This event is launched when the Bridgefy service stops.
    bridgefyEmitter.addListener(('onStopped', ()=> {
                        console.log('onStopped');
                      }
    );

    // This method is launched when a device is nearby and has established connection with the local user.
    // It receives a device dictionary.
    bridgefyEmitter.addListener(('onDeviceConnected', (device)=> {
          BridgefyClient.deviceList.push(device);
          console.log('onDeviceConnected: ' + device.DeviceName + " size: " + BridgefyClient.deviceList.length);
      }
    );
    // This method is launched when a connection attempt to a device failed. This event is iOS only.
    bridgefyEmitter.addListener(('onDeviceConnectFailed', (device)=> {
        console.log('onDeviceConnectFailed: ' + device);
      }
    );
    // This method is launched when there is a disconnection of a user.
    bridgefyEmitter.addListener(('onDeviceLost', (device)=> {
        console.log('onDeviceLost: ' + device);
      }
    );


    // This method is launched when a nearby device is detected (On-demand mode only)
    // It receives a device dictionary.
    bridgefyEmitter.addListener(('onDeviceDetected', (device)=> {
          console.log('onDeviceDetected: ' + device.DeviceName);
      }
    );
    // This method is launched when a nearby device is no more detected (On-demand mode only)
    bridgefyEmitter.addListener(('onDeviceUnavailable', (device)=> {
        console.log('onDeviceUnavailable: ' + device);
      }
    );

    // This is method is launched exclusively on iOS devices, notifies about certain actions like when
    // the bluetooth interface  needs to be activated, when internet is needed and others.
    bridgefyEmitter.addListener(('onEventOccurred', (event)=> {
                        console.log('Event code: ' + event.code + ' Description: ' + event.description);
                      }
    );
```
